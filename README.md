# JAVASCRIPT ASSESSMENT TEST

Here you can delete, create a new alt attribute for all images, and you can also select some specific images for which we want to create a new alt attribute
There are several indicators that need to be understood:

- #0075ff Blue. Just a hover effect
- #dd1313 Red. Shows in which image the alt attribute was changed
- #13dd24 Green. Selected image

Also, during loading, all images that do not have an alt attribute are automatically created
